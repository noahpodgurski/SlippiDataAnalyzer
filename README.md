# SlippiDataAnalyzer
Created for the purpose of analyzing data and creating useful graphs to show results such as win/loss, kills/deaths ratios based on characters played in Super Smash Bros. Melee

#How to Use:
1. If you already have python installed, skip to step 2. If you don't, you need to get it. Download it here You may also need NodeJS installed, but I don't believe so.

2. Open command prompt, enter pip install pandas matplotlib py-slippi, these are required python modules which it uses to function

3. Download Slippi Data Analyzer, unzip it, and put in your programs or desktop or wherever you want.

4. Open it and hit the CHOOSE FOLDER button on the left and select your C:/*your slippi installation location here*/slippi r18/Slippi folder. This is the default location where your slippi replays are held.

5. Enter your Netplay username exactly as you have it when you use Netplay

6. Hit Submit! When it's done it may or may not make a shit ton of graphs (each their own window), so if you have a slow-ish computer, maybe select a lower amount of .slp files, copy them into a separate folder, and start with that.
