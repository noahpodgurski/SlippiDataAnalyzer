# SlippiDataAnalyzer
Created for the purpose of analyzing data and creating useful graphs to show results such as win/loss, kills/deaths ratios based on characters played in Super Smash Bros. Melee

# How to Use:
1. Dependencies: Python, NodeJS

2. Open command prompt, enter `pip install pandas matplotlib py-slippi`, these are the required python modules

3. Download Slippi Data Analyzer

4. Open it and hit the CHOOSE FOLDER button on the left and select your C:/*your slippi installation location here*/slippi r18/Slippi folder. This is the default location where your slippi replays are held.

5. Enter your Netplay username exactly as you have it when you use Netplay

6. Hit Submit! When it's done it may or may not make a shit ton of graphs (each their own window), so if you have a slow-ish computer, maybe select a lower amount of .slp files, copy them into a separate folder, and start with that.
